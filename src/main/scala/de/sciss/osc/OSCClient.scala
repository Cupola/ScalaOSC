/**
 *	This class groups together a transmitter and receiver, allowing bidirectional
 *	OSC communication from the perspective of a client. It simplifies the
 *	need to use several objects by uniting their functionality.
 *	</P><P>
 *	In the following example, a client for UDP to SuperCollider server (scsynth)
 *	on the local machine is created. The client starts a synth by sending
 *	a <code>/s_new</code> message, and stops the synth by sending a delayed
 *	a <code>/n_set</code> message. It waits for the synth to die which is recognized
 *	by an incoming <code>/n_end</code> message from scsynth after we've registered
 *	using a <code>/notify</code> command.
